# Stack

## Overview
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This implementation uses a Go slice as the underlying storage.

## Operations & Time Complexity
| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Push | O(1)* | O(1) |
| Pop | O(1) | O(1) |
| Peek | O(1) | O(1) |
| IsEmpty | O(1) | O(1) |
| Size | O(1) | O(1) |

*Amortized O(1), may trigger slice reallocation
