# Binary Tree

## Overview
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right). This implementation provides common traversal algorithms and tree property calculations.

## Operations & Time Complexity
| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Inorder Traversal | O(n) | O(h) |
| Preorder Traversal | O(n) | O(h) |
| Postorder Traversal | O(n) | O(h) |
| Level Order Traversal | O(n) | O(w) |
| Height | O(n) | O(h) |
| CountNodes | O(n) | O(h) |

h = height of tree, w = max width of tree
