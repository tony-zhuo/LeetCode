# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

Track the **minimum price seen so far** while iterating:

1. For each price, update the minimum if it's lower.
2. Otherwise, compute the profit (`price - min_price`) and update the max profit.

**Time complexity:** O(n)
**Space complexity:** O(1)
