# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

## Description

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Solution

Use **recursion** to merge in-place:

1. If either list is `nil`, return the other.
2. Compare the head values — whichever is smaller becomes the head of the result.
3. Recursively merge the rest.

**Time complexity:** O(n + m)
**Space complexity:** O(n + m) due to recursion stack
